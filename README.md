The code demonstrates an analysis of product price distribution using data from a CSV file.
It utilizes Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn to read the data, visualize it with a scatter plot, and perform linear regression.

The initial step involves reading the CSV file containing product versions and prices using the pandas library. The data is then plotted 
using a scatter plot to visualize the distribution of product prices based on their respective versions.

Next, the code utilizes scikit-learn's LinearRegression class to fit a linear regression model to the data. This allows for the estimation
of a linear relationship between the product version and its corresponding price.

Finally, the code predicts the price for a specific product version using the trained linear regression model.
The predicted price provides insights into how prices may vary based on different product versions.

This analysis helps to understand the relationship between product versions and their prices, 
enabling businesses and consumers to make informed decisions based on pricing trends and predictions.
